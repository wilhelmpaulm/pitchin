# PitchIn
### A social centric event planning application designed to make small to medium scale gatherings more collaborative


## Development

###This project is built with my love and the [Laravel Framework](http://laravel.com)

This application is intended in the partial fulfillment of
one of my college courses HUCOMIN which is human computer interactions

I'm acting as the lead developer and designer as well as the 
proponent of the idea.
